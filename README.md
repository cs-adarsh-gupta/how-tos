## Overall Process  
The below process assumes the partner to be a Fortinet Alliance Partner, hence please ensure you are signed up as one. More details are available at https://www.fortinet.com/partners/partnerships/alliance-partners.  

* Partner shares intent with FortiSOAR team to prepare and submit a new content
An email sharing details about the intent can be sent to fsr-integrations@fortinet.com. The email should help us understand the following:  
> - If its a connector to integrate with a specific product; or a mulit-content solution pack addressing an end-to-end use case
> - Name and version of the security product(s) you are planning to write the pack for 
> - What prompted you to write this pack?  
> - Are there any timelines you are looking to complete this by?  
 
* FortiSOAR team helps partner to setup Git repos, SDK and provides any required help 
As part of this process, FortiSOAR team will help the partner with: 
> - Setting up Git Repos on https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/  
> - Introduce them to Fortinet Developer Network (FNDN) where the SDK, sample integrations, doc generator tool and other documentation is available 
> - Video tutorial demonstrating the integration and solution pack building exercise with recommended best practices and code structure 
> - A FortiSOAR trial license 
> - Point of contact to reach out in case of any assistance needed 

* Partner authors and submits a GitHub pull request for the content developed
Refer to https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/how-tos/blob/main/SubmitAPullRequest.md for steps to submit a Pull Request. FortiSOAR to do an initial sanity check on the code and suggest initial change or updates as suitable. Once the review comments are addressed, code will be merged to release branch. Only FortiSOAR team will have merge rights to FortiSOAR branch. 

* Partner to demo the Solution 
A suitable time is set forth for the partner to demo the content developed. If the solution is a connector, the partner is expected to first demo the security product for which integration is built and then describe how the integration within FortiSOAR can help customers.  
 
* FortiSOAR team to validate, test and certify the integration 
The submitted content then goes through a stringent certification process, where it is tested and validated across various parameters, some of them being the code quality, consistency, performance, version compatibility, user experience, vulnerabilities and other factors. If there are any changes needed as part of this process, a detailed document describing the same is sent to the partner. 
 
* Partner to work on changes and re-submit the content for final approval with a detailed documentation, a support alias and an integration page on their website 
Once certified, the content waits for the next closest cycle, where it is pushed to the FortiSOAR Content Hub for customers to consume. Along with the content, a documentation prepared by the partner and the support contact is linked to it.  
 
* Content published with Partner mention as the content publisher 
The content is made available on the FortiSOAR Content Hub.  
 
* Work with marketing team to build solution briefs, use case videos etc.  
FortiSOAR team introduces the partner to our marketing team, together with whom, the partner can collaborate to build out solution briefs, social posts, blogs, videos and other suitable marketing materials.  
 

## Integration Support & Maintenance 
There can be various scenarios where the need for supporting the content and managing expectations comes into picture. Some scenarios commonly faced are -  

**Change in existing product APIs** - This can break the existing functionality and has significant impact on customer playbooks and use cases. We will re-direct all such expectations to the partner to help answer and address. In general, we expect the partner to keep customers updated about API changes and prepare in advance for the updated integration.  

**New product APIs available** - Often products introduce new capabilities through the APIs and customers want to take benefit from the same. We will re-direct such requests to the partner for understanding priorities and updating the content. 

**Request for new actions/APIs** - For Connectors, customers often request for new actions, if the existing ones do not suffice their use cases. To validate such requirements, FortiSOAR team with work with the partner to help them understand the use cases. Based on the outcome, the partner can decide to plan the extended support or decide against, if not feasible at the moment. FortiSOAR team will communicate accordingly to the customer request.
