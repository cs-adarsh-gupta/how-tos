1. From the connector repository you are contributing to, use the “fork” option to create a copy of the repository under your Github account:
The below screenshot, for instance, shows forking from the malsilo connector github repository:

2. Once forked, you’ll see a note on your local copy that it has been forked. 
The below screenshot shows a forked copy of the ‘connector-malsilo’ repository in the private github account of a user ‘fortisoar-community’

3. Add the connector enhancements and bug-fixes into the local repository and unit test

4. Once the changes are ready to be merged, create a pull request from a branch in your forked repository to the ‘develop’ branch on the parent ‘fortinet-fortisoar’ repository
